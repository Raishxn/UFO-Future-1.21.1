# Stellar Fragments

Unlike common metals, the advanced materials in UFO Future are not found in nature. They must be **synthesized** artificially by fusing matter under extreme conditions.

## White Dwarf Fragment
This is the base material for most of the mod's technology.

### Acquisition
The **White Dwarf Fragment Ingot** is created exclusively in the **Dimensional Matter Assembler (DMA)**. The process involves compressing materials using reactive fluids.

## Other Materials
As you progress, you will be able to synthesize even denser and more energetic materials in the DMA:

* **Neutron Star Fragment**: <item id="ufo:neutron_star_fragment_ingot" />
* **Pulsar Fragment**: <item id="ufo:pulsar_fragment_ingot" />

These ingots are essential for crafting **Mega Co-Processors** and high-tier storage components.
