# UFO Armor — Player Guide

The UFO Armor Set is an advanced high-tier armor providing unique survival mechanics, thermal protection, and powerful passive effects.

---

# 🛡️ Full Set Bonuses

When a player wears the **complete UFO Armor set (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)**:

## ✔ **Invulnerability to /kill**
Players cannot be killed by the `/kill` command.  
This includes:
- `/kill @p`
- `/kill @a`
- Admin-triggered kill commands

This makes the armor ideal for:
- Boss arenas
- Anti-cheat safe zones
- Admin events
- High-risk dimensions

---

## ✔ **Void Death Immunity**
If the player falls into the **Void**, they **do not die**.

Typical behavior:
- HP does not decrease from void damage.
- Player remains alive even at Y < -64 or in custom void dimensions.
- Server owners can add optional “teleport-back” plugins if desired.

---

## ✔ **Thermal Protection**
UFO Armor integrates with the DMA Thermo System:

- Prevents **heat damage** caused by overheated machines.
- Allows players to safely stand near DMAs in **OVERHEAT**, **INEFFICIENCY**, and even **DESTABILIZATION** zones.
- Reduces or nullifies environmental fire or lava-based temperature spikes.

Useful during:
- DMA meltdown recovery
- Debugging coolant failures
- High-heat crafting sessions

---

## ✔ Additional Suggested Bonuses (if your mod includes them)
Depending on your version of the mod, UFO Armor may also grant:

- Bonus armor points above Netherite
- Knockback resistance
- Fire immunity or strong resistance
- Radiation/energy shielding (if Mekanism integration enabled)
- Increased mining speed
- Explosion resistance

Add or remove these effects depending on your mod configuration.

- Coolant-depleted thermal danger zones
- Hazardous fluid tanks (Liquid Starlight, Transcending Matter Fluid, Cryotheum, etc.)

### Boss Hunts & PvE

---

# 🔧 Crafting Source
UFO Armor is usually a **mid-to-late game craft** requiring:
- Star-matter alloys
- High-tier fluids
- Processor components
- DMA crafting steps

Server owners may gate the armor behind:
- Quests
- Boss drops
- Multiple DMA tiers
- Fusion-like multi-block structures

---

# 🧪 Extra Tips & Server Notes

- Consider disabling UFO Armor `/kill` immunity for PvP servers if needed.
- For lore-based packs, this armor fits as “interdimensional exo-suit technology”.
- If combined with Thermal Exosuit, players become completely immune to heat and environmental damage.
