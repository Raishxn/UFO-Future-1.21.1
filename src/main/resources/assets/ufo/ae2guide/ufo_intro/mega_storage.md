# Mega Crafting Storage

When standard AE2 crafting CPUs are insufficient for your massive automation tasks, **UFO Future** provides **Mega Crafting Storage** units.

## Extreme Capabilities
These units allow you to perform crafting jobs with virtually infinite complexity and byte counts.

### Available Tiers
The technology scales to astronomical levels:
1.  **1M - 256M**: For standard late-game.
2.  **1B (Billion)**: <item id="ufo:1b_mega_crafting_storage" />
3.  **1T (Trillion)**: <item id="ufo:1t_mega_crafting_storage" />
4.  **1QD (Quadrillion)**: <item id="ufo:1qd_mega_crafting_storage" />

## Mega Co-Processors
To keep up with massive storage, **Mega Co-Processors** ensure your tasks are processed in parallel with unmatched speed.
