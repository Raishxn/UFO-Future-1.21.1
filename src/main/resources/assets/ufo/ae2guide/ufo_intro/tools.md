# UFO Future Tools — Player Guide
...

UFO Future introduces a set of advanced tools with progression, passive effects, and unique mechanics.  
This guide explains how each tool behaves and how players can use or upgrade them efficiently.

# 🔨 Pickaxes — Fortune Progression + Auto-Smelt

## Fortune Leveling System
UFO Future pickaxes feature a **progressive Fortune system**:

- Every **ore block** mined with the pickaxe grants **+1 Fortune level**.
- Maximum Fortune: **100**.
- Fortune level is **saved on the tool** (persistent between sessions).
- Breaking non-ores does **not** increase Fortune.

### Why this matters
- Early-game → behaves like normal pickaxe
- Mid-game → becomes Fortune V+
- Endgame → reaches Fortune 100, massively increasing rare drops

---

## Auto-Smelt Mode
All UFO Future **pickaxes** include **Auto-Smelt**:

- When mining blocks that have furnace-smelted versions (e.g., Iron Ore → Iron Ingot),  
  the pickaxe outputs the **smelted result automatically**.
- Works with Silk Touch disabled.
- Works on modded ores if they define appropriate smelting recipes.

### Auto-Smelt + Fortune Interaction
- Auto-Smelt applies **before** Fortune.
- That means blocks that normally drop items (not the block itself) get multiplied *after* smelting.

# 🔨 Hammer — Area Mining + Auto-Smelt

The **Hammer** is a large-area mining tool.

## Area of Effect
- Mines a **3×3×1** area by default (configurable depending on your mod build).
- Breaks stone-like blocks, ores, and modded stone variants.

## Auto-Smelt
- Same Auto-Smelt system as the pickaxe.
- Smelts ALL blocks in the AoE that have smeltable outputs.

## Efficiency Tips
- Use hammers for tunneling or mass-mining.
- Combine with high-tier coolant systems to keep large DMA crafting runs supplied with minerals.

# 🗡️ Swords — Damage & Looting Progression

UFO Future swords scale automatically as players fight.

## Kill-Based Progression
Every time you kill a **hostile mob**, your sword gains:

- **+1 Attack Damage** (NO LIMIT)
- **+1 Looting Level** (up to **Looting 100**)

### Rules
- Only hostile mob kills count (zombies, skeletons, creepers, etc.).
- Attack Damage has **no cap** — swords can scale infinitely.
- Looting is capped at **100** to avoid extreme overflow.

### Why this is powerful
- Long-term players naturally progress their sword into a  
  **hyper-endgame weapon** without crafting.
- Perfect for servers that reward grinding and exploration.
